Python Lists



Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, 
all with different qualities and usage.

Lists are created using square brackets:
Create a List example:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)



List Items
List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.



Changeable
The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.

Allow Duplicates
Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value:

Example
Lists allow duplicate values:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry"]
print(thislist)


List Length
To determine how many items a list has, use the len() function:

Example:-
Print the number of items in the list:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(len(thislist))


List Items - Data Types
List items can be of any data type:

Example
String, int and boolean data types:

list1 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
list2 = [1, 5, 7, 9, 3]
list3 = [True, False, False]
A list can contain different data types:

Example
A list with strings, integers and boolean values:

list1 = ["abc", 34, True, 40, "male"]
type()
From Python's perspective, lists are defined as objects with the data type 'list':

<class 'list'>
Example
What is the data type of a list?

mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(type(mylist))



The list() Constructor
It is also possible to use the list() constructor when creating a new list.

Example
Using the list() constructor to make a List:

thislist = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
print(thislist)


Python Collections (Arrays)
There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.
*Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove and/or add items whenever you like.
