Problem: Sum of All Divisors from 1 to n
Given a positive integer n, calculate the value of Î£F(i) where i ranges from 1 to n, and F(i) is the sum of all divisors of i.
 
Examples:
# Input: n = 4
# Output: 15
# Explanation:
# F(1) = 1
# F(2) = 1 + 2 = 3
# F(3) = 1 + 3 = 4
# F(4) = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7
# Total = 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 = 15
 
# Input: n = 5
# Output: 21
# Explanation:
# F(1) = 1
# F(2) = 1 + 2 = 3
# F(3) = 1 + 3 = 4
# F(4) = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7
# F(5) = 1 + 5 = 6
# Total = 1 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 6 = 21

Approach 1:Better Method
    Explanation:
     - Loop through each number `i` from 1 to n.
     - For each `i`, find all its divisors `j` using another loop.
     - Add all these divisors to a running total.

# Time Complexity: O(n^2)
# Space Complexity: O(1)

"""
 Approach 2: Optimized Method
 Explanation:
     - Instead of finding divisors for each number, calculate how much each number contributes as a divisor.
     - A number `i` is a divisor of all its multiples. Its total contribution is `i * (n // i)`,
       where `n // i` is the count of numbers divisible by `i`.
